            <h2>Incredible unique wildlife</h2>
            <p>
              The animals of New Zealand, part of its biota, have an unusual
              history because, before the arrival of humans, less than 900 years
              ago, the country was mostly free of mammals, except those that
              could swim there (seals, sea lions, and, off-shore, whales and
              dolphins) or fly there (bats). However, as recently as the
              Miocene, it was home to the terrestrial Saint Bathans mammal,
              implying that mammals had been present since the island had broken
              away from other landmasses. The absence of mammals meant that all
              of the ecological niches occupied by mammals elsewhere were
              occupied instead by either insects or birds, leading to an
              unusually large number of flightless birds, including the kiwi,
              the weka, the moa (now extinct), the takahē, and the kākāpō. A
              tuatara, sometimes described as a "living fossil" Diversity of
              marine mollusc shells at Akaroa Beach, New Zealand Because of the
              lack of predators, even bats spend most of their time on the
              ground. There are also about 60 species of lizard (30 each of
              gecko and skink), four species of frog (all rare and endangered),
              and the tuatara (reptiles resembling lizards but with a distinct
              lineage).

            <p>
              Hi, my name is Alana and I spent some time travelling in New
              Zealand a few years ago. It is one of the most beautiful places in
              the world. It's breathtaking landscapes, unique wildlife and
              friendly people made it really feel like a place I could call
              home.
